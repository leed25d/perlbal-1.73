Reference stub for 'SET pool' commands.

SET pool nodefile = '/path/to/file'
... sets the file to autoload nodes from. Perlbal will periodically check this
file for updates.

SET pool nodefile = none 
(also undef, null, "", '')
... unsets the nodefile, but does not remove current members.

SET pool balance_method = 'random'
... sets the load balancing method to 'random', which is all there is!
